# Cosmic Monkey

This is a quick onboarding puzzle for new members to the Flight Software (FSW) subgroup of Brown Space Engineering. It's designed to help you get acquainted with C (and all of its weirdness).
In order to correctly write the `cosmic_monkey` function (and its accompanying `print_bytes` function for visualizing the result), you'll learn about pointers, bitwise operators, 
and bit masking â€” all of which are central to embedded systems programming.

## Motivation

The name "Cosmic Monkey" comes from Netflix's "Chaos Monkey", which is a process that randomly terminates virtual machines and containers in the company's production environment to ensure that their software engineers
implement their services to be resilient to instance failures. In our satellite's operating system ([PVDXosV2](https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/PVDXosV2)), we have implemented a similar task that randomly flips bits to simulate what would happen
if memory is corrupted by cosmic ray bit-flips. We have no control over when/where this radiation will mutate our memory, so having an angry task that goes around flipping bits is the best way
to make sure PVDXos can recover if critical memory is corrupted.
